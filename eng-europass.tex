\ecvsection{Work experience}

\ecvworkexperience{June 2015 -- Present}{Project engineer}{Package Innovation and Design Center - ABRE}{\href{http://www.centroabre.com}{http://www.centroabre.com}}
{
Project management activities such as defining schedules (Gantt charts), delimiting projects by SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals/deliverables, making business proposals to clients, negotiating the details, following up the project progress, contacting consultants, managing budgets and reporting the results.
}

\ecvworkexperience{2014 -- 2015}{Intern}{Package Innovation and Design Center - ABRE}{\href{http://www.centroabre.com}{http://www.centroabre.com}}
{
Writing of project results reports and other technical documentation. Some intervention in industry projects. Minor technological explorations/research, software development and configuration. Interaction with costumers (phone, email), writing of form, mandatory documents to support project management and making of presentations to sell our projects.
}

\ecvworkexperience{2014}{External research assistant}{UDEM Engineering department}{\href{http://udem.edu}{http://udem.edu}}
{
Exploration to justify the acquisition of drones by the university. The project resulted in the university getting three drones, which unfortunately have not been applied due to a lack of resources designated to their exploitation. During the project I gathered an important background of common drone jargon, software, components, potential applications, etc. I have also manually flown a drone a couple of times (low resolution proof: \href{https://youtu.be/M4OMHGeACiA}{https://youtu.be/M4OMHGeACiA}), also having a couple of crashes of experience.
}

\ecvworkexperience{2014}{Intern}{Laboratoire de Conception et d'Intégration des Systèmes}{Valence, France, \href{http://lcis.grenoble-inp.fr}{http://lcis.grenoble-inp.fr}}
{
Work during a 4.5 months long stay at Valence that resulted in the development and implementation of a GPU-accelerated algorithm to solve the stereo vision matching problem (thought towards applying it on an autonomous vehicle system). Work on reading images from a couple of cameras using two different STM32 boards was also carried on: the MCU code was completely interrupt-driven. Programming languages used: C, C++, GLSL. The project involved: I2C, DCMI, DMA, SPI, OpenGL, debian, real-time linux scheduling policies.
}

\ecvworkexperience{2014}{Intern}{UDEM Autonomous supermileage vehicle}{\href{http://udem.edu}{http://udem.edu}}
{
Drive-by-wire steering mechanism design; mechanical (gears, chains, shafts, etc) and electronic (microcontrollers, regulators, transceivers, etc) components selection and purchase; PIC microcontrollers and raspberry programming and integration into a CAN network; modeling and simulation of the vehicle and its environment to test computer vision algorithms. Programming languages used: C, C++, Java, matlab, simulink, lua. The project involved: UART, PWM, I2C, CAN, TCP/IP, SSH, debian.
}

\ecvworkexperience{2013}{Intern}{Fukushima Lab, Tokyo Institute of Technology}{\href{http://www.3mech.titech.ac.jp/ma_hirose/ma_hirose_e.html}{http://www.3mech.titech.ac.jp/ma\_hirose/ma\_hirose\_e.html}}
{
Remote work (weekly Skype meetings) consisting in the design, development and implementation of distributed software for a simulated service robot. The project applied robotics middleware (specifically RT-Middleware and ROS, connected through web sockets) and simulators (specifically V-REP and Gazebo) to develop the software that would make a service robot react to visual commands (detected using OpenCV) to navigate through its environment. Programming languages used: C, C++, Java, lua (an advantage of using middleware is that you can easily break a task across different programs, even if they are written in different programming languages). The project involved computer vision and the robot direct/inverse kinematics.
}

\ecvworkexperience{2010 -- 2014}{Scholarship service}{UDEM Academic vice-presidency}{\href{http://udem.edu}{http://udem.edu}}
{
Proposal, design and implementation of solutions for different data handling problems: WLAN collaboration platform (HTML5, AJAX), strategic planning tracing platform (PHP, MySQL), interfaces between excel sheets and html forms (javascript), automatic generation of documents from a database (VBA), amongst other similar TI solutions.
}

\ecvworkexperience{2013}{Research assistant}{UDEM Engineering deparment}{\href{http://udem.edu}{http://udem.edu}}
{
Work to support Dr. Santiago Cruz research on mechanical vibrations. Dr. Cruz developed a novel algorithm to approximate the solution of structure vibrations applying the Finite Element Method and the Laplace Transform. The intervention consisted in improving the modularity of the software to be able to implement unit testing and validate the algorithm on different problems. I also added the functionality to plot and simulate the results by drawing and animating the graphs and the vibrating structures. Programming language used: matlab.
}

\ecvworkexperience{2012}{Contestant}{The Freescale Cup Team}{}
{
Small-scale line follower car design contest organized by Freescale Semiconductor and Continental Automotive. The project consisted in designing the electronic circuit to interface to the components and programming Freescale's MPC5604B board to read a linear camera and operate the servomotors. Programming languages used: C. The project involved: ADC, PWM, scheduler.
