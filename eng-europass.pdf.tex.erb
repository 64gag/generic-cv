\ecvsection{Work experience}

\ecvworkexperience{Oct 2016 -- Present}{R\&D Software Engineer}{Squadrone System}{\href{http://www.squadrone-system.com}{http://www.squadrone-system.com}}
{
Research on and development of autonomous drones oriented towards industrial applications (focus on the Logistics, Security and Assurance markets). I have worked on software at the embedded and application layers, and also on support projects such as simulation of 3D environments to make design decisions.\par
\textbf{Keywords:} C, C++, python, NuttX, ROS, Gazebo, RTOS, drivers, OpenCV, Linux
}

\ecvworkexperience{Jan 2016 -- Oct 2016}{Software Engineer, Consultancy}{Freelance}{}
{
Design, development and management of vertical software projects as requested by my clients. Projects were of an IT nature: databases, security, sharing of data. I was the only one involved in the software development and project management.\par
\textbf{Keywords:} SaaS, AWS, SQL, Ruby on Rails, HTML
}

\ecvworkexperience{Sept 2014 -- Dec 2015}{Intern and Project engineer}{Package Innovation and Design Center - ABRE}{\href{http://www.centroabre.com}{http://www.centroabre.com}}
{
Mostly project management activities but also had some direct engineering involvement in industry projects. Very valuable experience in breaking down projects into goals/deliverables, defining schedules, making business proposals to clients, negotiating the details, following up the project progress, contacting consultants, managing budgets and results reporting.\par
\textbf{Keywords:} project management, budgets, schedules, Gantt
}

\ecvworkexperience{April -- Aug 2014}{Intern}{Laboratoire de Conception et d'Intégration des Systèmes}{Valence, France, \href{http://lcis.grenoble-inp.fr}{http://lcis.grenoble-inp.fr}}
{
Work during a 4.5 months long stay at Valence that resulted in the development and implementation of a GPU-accelerated algorithm to solve the stereo vision matching problem (thought towards applying it on an autonomous vehicle system). Work on reading images from a couple of camera sensors using two different, interrupt-driven STM32 boards.\par
\textbf{Keywords:} GPGPU, GLSL, C, C++, I2C, DCMI, DMA, SPI, OpenGL, RT Linux scheduling
}

\ecvworkexperience{2014}{Intern}{UDEM Autonomous supermileage vehicle}{\href{http://udem.edu}{http://udem.edu}}
{
State of the art research/exploration; electronic and software architecture design; modeling and simulation of the vehicle's dynamics and its environment to test computer vision algorithms; PIC microcontrollers and raspberry programming and integration into a CAN network; drive-by-wire steering mechanism design; mechanical and electronic components selection and purchase.\par
\textbf{Keywords:} C, C++, Java, matlab, simulink, lua, MCU, CAN, OpenCV, ROS, Gazebo, PIC
}

\ecvworkexperience{2013}{Intern}{Fukushima Lab, Tokyo Institute of Technology}{\href{http://www.3mech.titech.ac.jp/ma_hirose/ma_hirose_e.html}{http://www.3mech.titech.ac.jp/ma\_hirose/ma\_hirose\_e.html}}
{
Remote work (weekly Skype meetings) consisting in the design, development and implementation of distributed software for a simulated service robot. The project applied robotics middleware and simulators to develop the software that would make a service robot react to visual commands to navigate through its environment.\par
\textbf{Keywords:} OpenRTM, ROS, V-REP, Gazebo, websockets, OpenCV, C, C++, Java, lua, direct/inverse kinematics
}

\ecvworkexperience{2013}{Research assistant}{UDEM Engineering deparment}{\href{http://udem.edu}{http://udem.edu}}
{
Work to support Dr. Santiago Cruz research on a novel algorithm to approximate the solution of structure vibrations applying the Finite Element Method and the Laplace Transform. I added the functionality to plot, simulate and animate the vibrating structures; and improved the modularity of the software to automate validation of the algorithm on different datasets.\par
\textbf{Keywords:} matlab, dynamics, Laplace transform, finite elements
}

\ecvworkexperience{2010 -- 2014}{Scholarship service}{UDEM Academic vice-presidency}{\href{http://udem.edu}{http://udem.edu}}
{
Proposal, design and implementation of solutions for different data handling problems: WLAN collaboration platform, strategic planning tracing platform, interfaces between excel sheets and html forms, automatic generation of documents from a database, amongst other similar IT solutions.\par
\textbf{Keywords:} MySQL, PHP, VBA, HTML5, javascript, AJAX, AWS, Ruby on Rails, apache
